JPDB does not have an auto suspend feature for leeches like anki.

If you are a patreon you can use a couple labs features together to approximate something similar.

I reckon this is not useful for total beginners.
For me it reduces my review load substantially.


## Setup {#setup}

In [Labs Settings](https://jpdb.io/labs/settings):
Activate "show failed cards last" and "cycle through failed cards before showing them again".


## Review {#review}

Review as you normally do. At some point you will only have failed cards left. Go through these once or twice (this is why we enabled cycling).


## Abandon {#abandon}

At this point you only have failed cards left that didn't manage to stick after a couple repeats. In other words leeches.

Go to the lab settings again and activate "override default failed carded cooldown period". Set it to something low like 2 seconds.

Now all your failed cards should be due instantly. Hit [abandon](https://jpdb.io/labs/abandon-due-and-failed) and they are gone from your rotation until you add them again.


## Closing thoughts {#closing-thoughts}

Don't worry about your known count regressing or something along those lines.
If a card doesn't survive this process its not worth SRSing. Add it again once it comes up in immersion.

I do this every couple days. I feel confident in adding as many cards as I want now, knowing that i can just sieve them out easily if they don't stick.
